To the People of the State of New York: 

THE current federal government has proven itself inefficient. You are thus called upon to consider a new Constitution for the United States of America. The importance of your charge is self-evident. Dependent on your deliberations are nothing less than the existence of the Union, the safety and welfare of its components, and the fate of perhaps the most significant empire in the world. Make no mistake of the uniqueness of this moment. It is the moment in which we will finally answer that question that has perhaps been reserved for the people of this country: whether or not socieities of men are capable of constructing good government solely by their facultiesi of rationality, or whether their political systems will always depend on untamed chance, inherited for example in the wake of conquest. If indeed this question has been reserved for this people and this time, then our responsibility in answering it correctly extends beyond ourselves to all makind.

Expanding the scope of our responsibility in this way will reshape our motivation from pure patriotism into a more general philanthropy. This will be hopefully serve as a bulwark against decisions corrupted by considerations not connected wit hthe public good. However, this hope is naive. The Constitution we must judge affects too many interests and proposes change to too many already formed institutions. Naturally, the conversation to come will be subject to many influences that are indifferent or antithetical, in their own ways, to the discover of truth.
