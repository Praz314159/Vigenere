The story of the forging of India, the world's largest democracy, is a rich and inspiring one. This volume, a sequel to the bestselling "India's Struggle for Independence," analyses the challenges India has faced and the successes it has achieved in the light of its colonial legacy and century-long struggle for freedom. This is a remarkable account of a naiton on the move. In "The Evolution of Beauty", Richard O. Prum/s academic career as an ornithologist and his lifelong passion for bird-watching come together in a thrilling intellectual adventure seeking to explain the incredible diversity of beauty in nature Scientific dogma holds that every detail of an animal's mating displays -- every spot on the peacock's tail -- is an advertisement of its genetic or material superiority. But deep in tropical jungles are birds with a dizzying array of plumages, songs, and other displays -- traits that are highly unlikely to provide practical information. After thirty years of field researh, Prum embraces a little-known theory of Darwin's: aesthetic mate choice. Choosing a mate for the mere pleasure of it, Darwin proposed, is an independent engine of evolutionary change. With warmth, wit, and charming virtuosity, Prum connects evolutionary dynamics to the origins and diversity of human sexuality and ideas of beauty. This is an exhilerating tour de force that begisn in the trees and ends by fundamentally challenging how we understand human behavior.
